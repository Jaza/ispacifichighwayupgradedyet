This is just a fun little site to indicate if the Pacific Highway in Australia has been fully upgraded yet.

The purpose of this site is to inform, to entertain, and to give the government oh so teeny tiny a nudge in getting on with the job.

This site is an independent work, and is not affiliated in any way with the NSW government, the Australian government, or any other official body.

No responsibility is taken for the accuracy of information on this site. A reasonable attempt has been made to provide correct facts, and to cite all sources.
